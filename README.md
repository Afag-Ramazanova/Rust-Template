# SAM_Lambda_DynDB
This will be a project designed to develop a CRUD capable lamda function in Rust which then links to DynamoDB. The goal here is to develop and test this locally via the SAM CLI and then deploy via the SAM template to generate the cloudformation stack. This project should provide insights into developing with the Rust language.
